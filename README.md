# Scala ADT support for Apache Flink

This is a prototype of Magnolia-based serializer framework for Apache Flink, with
more Scala-specific TypeSerializer & TypeInformation derivation support.

* can support ADTs (Algebraic data types, sealed trait hierarchies)
* correctly handles `case object` 
* can be extended with custom serializers even for deeply-nested types, as it uses implicitly available serializers
  in the current scope
* has no silent fallback to Kryo: it will just fail the compilation in a case when serializer cannot be made
* reuses all the low-level serialization code from Flink for basic Java and Scala types
* supports Scala 2.12, 2.13 & 3.
* built for scala-free Flink 1.15, which supports arbitrary Scala versions.

Issues:
* as this project relies on macro to derive TypeSerializer instances, if you're using IntelliJ 2020.*, it may
highlight your code with red, hinting that it cannot find corresponding implicits. And this is fine, the code
compiles OK. 2022.1 is fine with serializers derived with this library.
  
## Usage

`flink-adt` is released to Maven-central. For SBT, add this snippet to `build.sbt`:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.findify" %% "flink-adt" % "0.5.0"
```

To use this library, swap `import org.apache.flink.api.scala._` with `import io.findify.flinkadt.api._` and enjoy.

So to derive a TypeInformation for a sealed trait, you can do:
```scala
import io.findify.flinkadt.api._
import org.apache.flink.api.common.typeinfo.TypeInformation

sealed trait Event extends Product with Serializable

object Event {
  final case class Click(id: String) extends Event
  final case class Purchase(price: Double) extends Event

  implicit val eventTypeInfo: TypeInformation[Event] = deriveTypeInformation
}
```

Be careful with a wildcard import of `import org.apache.flink.api.scala._`: it has a `createTypeInformation` implicit
function, which may happily generate you a kryo-based serializer in a place you never expected. So in a case if you want
to do this type of wildcard import, make sure that you explicitly called `deriveTypeInformation`
for all the sealed traits in the current scope.

## Schema evolution

For the child case classes being part of ADT, `flink-adt` uses a Flink's `ScalaCaseClassSerializer`, so all the compatibility rules
are the same as for normal case classes.

For the sealed trait membership itself, `flink-adt` used an own serialization format with the following rules:
* you cannot reorder trait members, as wire format depends on the compile-time index of each member
* you can add new members at the end of the list
* you cannot remove ADT members
* you cannot replace ADT members

## Compatibility

This project uses a separate set of serializers for collections, instead of Flink's own TraversableSerializer. So probably you
may have issues while migrating state snapshots from TraversableSerializer to FlinkADT ones.
